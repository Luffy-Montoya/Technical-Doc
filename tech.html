        <p class="firstp">The Straw Hat Pirates are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue. The "Straw Hats" are named after their captain Luffy's signature straw hat. Despite their small size, the Straw Hats are an extremely diverse group, possessing a wide variety of skills and coming from an array of backgrounds.  While they all have different goals, ambitions, and dreams, they all share the same mission... to find the One Piece.

        <p>Luffy is the founder, captain, and strongest fighter of the Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues the One Piece, the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger, in order to become the new King of the Pirates and reach a further, untold dream. His greatest inspiration was the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who sacrificed an arm to save his life, unknowingly enabled him to eat the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, and gave him his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite when Luffy becomes a great pirate.</p>

Twenty years later, Robin joined the Straw Hats in pursuit of the Rio Poneglyph which will hopefully tell that history.</p>
